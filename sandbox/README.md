# Van Reactive Element: Interactive Sandbox

This directory contains an interactive demo of Van Reactive Element features.

## Running the Sandbox

From the project root:

```bash
npm run sandbox
```

This will start a Vite server and open the sandbox in your browser.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `main.ts` - Entry point that sets up all demos
- `demo.ts` - Contains all the demo implementations
- `styles.css` - Styling for the sandbox
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Basic HTML Rendering** - Simple templates with nested elements
2. **Reactive State** - VanJS state management with two-way binding

## Development

The sandbox uses TypeScript and hot module reloading for a smooth development experience. Make changes to any file and see them reflected immediately in the browser.
